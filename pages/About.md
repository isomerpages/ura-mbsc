**Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2024**

This December, prepare to be dazzled by stunning fireworks displays at Marina Bay, as part of the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2024, Singapore’s largest countdown celebration. With a wide array of fun and exciting activities lined up for people from all walks of life, this year’s Countdown will be a showcase of immersive and inspiring experiences, bringing everyone together to reflect on our triumphs and the challenges of the past year and welcome the new year with the promise of a new beginning.

Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the highly anticipated Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2024 will, for the first time ever, feature additional fireworks displays before midnight, perfect for families with children with early bedtimes, or any reveller looking to join in the festivities and catch the thrilling fireworks at an earlier time. These displays will build up to a 12-minute grand finale at midnight to usher in the new year, and revellers can look forward to a sensory feast for the eyes and ears.

Marina Bay will also be transformed into a vibrant hub of activities, from inspiring light projections and a pop-up winter playground to a go-kart arena in the heart of the city with a beer garden. This year’s Countdown invites everyone to come together to create and celebrate timeless moments.
