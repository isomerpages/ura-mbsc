<p>As we ring in our nation's 60th birthday this new year, let's also take
a moment to make a difference in the lives of communities in need.</p>
<p>By contributing to the [SHARE](https://www.giving.sg/donate/campaign/sg60share) programme by [Community Chest](https://www.comchest.gov.sg/brand/share/for-individuals), you will be supporting critical programmes that help children with special needs and youth at risk, adults with disabilities, persons with mental health conditions, and families and seniors in need.​</p>
<p>100% of your contribution will go towards supporting those in need. So, join us in building a shared future for all today.​</p>
