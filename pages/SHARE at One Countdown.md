<p>As we ring in our nation's 60th birthday this new year, let's also take
a moment to make a difference in the lives of communities in need.</p>
<p>By contributing to the SHARE programme by Community Chest, you will be
supporting critical needs across 5 key areas including seniors, children
and youth at risk, families in need of assistance, persons with mental
health and individuals with disabilities.​</p>
<p>100% of your contribution will go towards supporting service users. So,
join us in building a shared future for all today.​</p>
