<p><em>Ice Magic: Winter Wonderland</em>, Asia’s largest touring pop-up winter
playground, will be returning to Bayfront Event Space from 9 December 2023
to 21 January 2024. The attraction returns bigger and better, with a taller
and longer snow slope and dual-lane ice slide for thrill-seekers as well
as family-friendly rides such as a merry-go-round on a snowy landscape.
Visitors can also admire majestic ice sculptures or head over to the Ice
Magic arcade for more games and entertainment or to savour winter flavours
at food and beverage stalls.</p>
