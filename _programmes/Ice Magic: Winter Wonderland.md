Ice Magic: Winter Wonderland, Asiaâ€™s largest touring pop-up winter playground, returns to Marina Bay, Bayfront Event Space from 8 December 2023 to 21 January 2024. In this Big Top tent, this magical wonderland will transport visitors from the heat of our tropical island to a snowy world for a special indoor ice and snow experience, including snow slopes, ice slides, ice sculptures, and winter sports, coupled with dessert and drink bars. 

Look forward to an exhilarating time of games and entertainment in this winter wonderland!
