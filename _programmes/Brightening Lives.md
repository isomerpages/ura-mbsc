A joint initiative with Community Partner, The Majurity Trust (TMT), the Brightening Lives campaign is a community engagement project that showcases original artworks on three iconic facades in Marina Bay  â€“  the ArtScience Museum, The Fullerton Hotel Singapore and the Merlion.

This edition of Brightening Lives will celebrate and feature the Singapore spirit of stepping up to uplift lives, taking action to meet unmet needs, and looking out for individuals and families who struggle behind closed doors. These will be showcased through co-created works of art by local students who were inspired by the stories of individuals, ground-up groups and charities in action. The artworks will then be adapted for the projection mapping shows that will light up Marina Bay.

From 26 to 31 December 2023, be enthralled by these nightly projection shows, which celebrate the acts of giving both big and small, and hope to inspire all to play a part to build a thriving community together.
