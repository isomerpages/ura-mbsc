<p>This year’s <strong><em>Brightening Lives</em></strong> light projections,
presented in collaboration with community partner and local philanthropic
organisation The Majurity Trust, will showcase a series of original artworks
created by artists with disabilities from ART:DIS, a local non-profit organisation
which seeks to provide learning and livelihood opportunities for persons
with disabilities through art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 26 to 31 December 2024, the facade of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore
will come alive with projections adapted from three newly commissioned
artworks, in addition to five existing artworks that reflect what it means
to thrive in Singapore. Running every 15 minutes from 8 pm to 10:30pm nightly
(with an additional last show at 10:45pm on 31 December 2024) – the vivid
artwork projections will collectively unfold a story of tenacity, resilience
and progress, portraying life’s journey from childhood aspirations to overcoming
challenges, ultimately envisioning a society where everyone can grow, contribute
and thrive.</p>
