<p>A joint initiative with Community Partner, The Majurity Trust (TMT), the
Brightening Lives campaign is a community engagement project that showcases
original artworks on The Fullerton Hotel Singapore.</p>
<p>This edition of Brightening Lives will focus on increasing awareness and
building understanding of the concept “Brightening Lives”. It aims to feature
the Singapore spirit of stepping up to uplift lives, taking action to meet
unmet needs, and looking out for individuals and families who struggle
behind closed doors so that everyone thrives. Similar to previous editions,
the campaign will culminate in a visually stunning projection mapping show,
mapped onto the iconic facade of The Fullerton Hotel in Marina Bay.</p>
<p>From 26 to 31 December 2024, be enthralled by these nightly projection
shows, which celebrate the acts of giving both big and small and hope to
inspire all to play a part to build a thriving community together.</p>
