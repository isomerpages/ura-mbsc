<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Birds to&nbsp;Amelia represent what we as Singaporeans go through in our
daily lives. In an ever-changing society, we have to adapt and endeavour
as we venture through life. Like fledglings taking their first flight,
we navigate different environments even as we long for the familiar and
tackle challenges such as mental health struggles as we pursue our dreams
of a brighter future for ourselves, our family and our future generations.
Through thick and thin, we face hardships head on and gain wisdom from
our experiences, as we grow and eventually break through like fully fledged
birds.</p>
