<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Nicole loves the varying shapes, colours and patterns of orchids. Most
associated with hybrids, the orchid was chosen as Singapore’s national
flower because it is reflective of our multicultural heritage and is the
key inspiration behind this piece.</p>

<p>Nicole Koo is an artist who is fascinated by the natural world. It comes
as no surprise then that the Botanic Gardens is her favourite place, where
she can spend hours on end, gazing at flowers. A graduate of Nanyang Academy
of Fine Arts, Nicole’s practice in watercolour captures the beauty of our
environment, creating an oasis of calm energy for herself and viewers.</p>
