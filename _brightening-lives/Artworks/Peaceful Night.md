<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>While on a night stroll in her neighbourhood, Zoe wondered what went on
behind each lit window. Was a family getting ready to have dinner, or was
a young couple settling in for a movie marathon? With each light twinkling
like stars in the night sky, Zoe hopes this painting reminds people to
always make time for their loved ones.</p>

father paint realistic compositions. Encouraged to be creative, Zoe pursued
an academic route that led her to a career as a graphic designer. With
formal training in visual language, her works demonstrate a keen awareness
of spatial harmony and rhythm.</p>
