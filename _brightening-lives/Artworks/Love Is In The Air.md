<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Named after the hit by John Paul Young, this painting of overlapping hearts
reminds people to treasure the little things in life. With his family by
his side and always there supporting him, Noah believes happiness can be
found anywhere as long as there is love. We can all thrive when we are
surrounded by loved ones who believe in us.</p>
