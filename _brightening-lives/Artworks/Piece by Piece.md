<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>This collaborative artwork about growth is inspired by building blocks,
which most people might recall from their childhood. Just as each block
in a structure comes in various shapes and sizes, so do our experiences,
abilities and the paths that we may take. The galaxy in the artwork represents
the vastness of a universe of potential, symbolising unlimited possibilities
and imagination. It also symbolises how we are all interconnected, representing
a collective sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Incorporated into the artwork as well are the artists’ unique aspirations.
Sophie aspires to be an artist while Crystal’s imagination flourishes in
nature. Crystal enjoys watching garden animals and insects such as snails
and butterflies, and decorating flowers. Brennan’s creativity comes alive
when he bakes, and he would like to be a baker someday. While the three
of them have different passions and capabilities, they believe that their
dreams, hard work and determination are still valid, no matter how long
it takes to get there.</p>

<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Birds to&nbsp;Amelia represent what we as Singaporeans go through in our
daily lives. In an ever-changing society, we have to adapt and endeavour
as we venture through life. Like fledglings taking their first flight,
we navigate different environments even as we long for the familiar and
tackle challenges such as mental health struggles as we pursue our dreams
of a brighter future for ourselves, our family and our future generations.
Through thick and thin, we face hardships head on and gain wisdom from
our experiences, as we grow and eventually break through like fully fledged
birds.</p>

<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>This artwork explores the interplay of inclusivity and empowerment. Singapore

society. Every one of us can achieve our goals if we believe in ourselves
and are supported. Given the right opportunities, we are empowered to succeed
in life if we persevere. No one can thrive or survive alone. We all need
each other, so we must help one another and live in harmony.</p>
