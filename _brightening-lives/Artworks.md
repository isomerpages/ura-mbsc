<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>This collaborative artwork about growth is inspired by building blocks,
which most people might recall from their childhood. Just as each block
in a structure comes in various shapes and sizes, so do our experiences,
abilities and the paths that we may take. The galaxy in the artwork represents
the vastness of a universe of potential, symbolising unlimited possibilities
and imagination. It also symbolises how we are all interconnected, representing
a collective sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Incorporated into the artwork as well are the artists’ unique aspirations.
Sophie aspires to be an artist while Crystal’s imagination flourishes in
nature. Crystal enjoys watching garden animals and insects such as snails
and butterflies, and decorating flowers. Brennan’s creativity comes alive
when he bakes, and he would like to be a baker someday. While the three
of them have different passions and capabilities, they believe that their
dreams, hard work and determination are still valid, no matter how long
it takes to get there.</p>
