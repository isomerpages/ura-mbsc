This December, prepare to be dazzled by stunning fireworks displays at Marina Bay, as part of the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2024, Singapore’s largest countdown celebration. With a wide array of fun and exciting activities, this year’s Countdown promises an unforgettable experience for all!

Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the highly anticipated Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2024 will feature an artisanal fireworks display produced by the team behind STAR ISLAND, the fireworks musical that mesmerised the crowd last year. 

Choreographed to tell a story of reflection and hope, the fireworks will light up the Bay across three chapters, unfolding at intervals in the hour leading up to midnight. Kicking off with a tribute to the past year’s challenges and triumphs, the fireworks will then herald the promise of new beginnings and thereafter, culminate to a 12-minute grand finale celebrating Singaporeans’ unyielding spirit as we embrace the future. Complete with specially curated music played through speakers around the Bay, the public can look forward to a sensory feast for the eyes and ears.

Marina Bay will also be transformed into a vibrant hub of activities, from inspiring light projections, a pop-up winter playground to a go-kart arena in the heart of the city with a rooftop deck and exciting live performances. This year’s Countdown invites everyone to come together to create and celebrate timeless moments.
