<p>This December, prepare to be dazzled by stunning fireworks displays at
Marina Bay, as part of the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2025, Singapore’s
largest countdown celebration. With a wide array of fun and exciting activities,
this year’s Countdown promises an unforgettable experience for all!</p>
<p>Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the highly anticipated
Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2025 will feature an artisanal fireworks
display produced by the team behind STAR ISLAND, the fireworks musical
that mesmerised the crowd last year.</p>
<p>Choreographed to tell a story of reflection and hope, the fireworks will
light up the Bay across three chapters, unfolding at intervals in the hour
leading up to midnight. Kicking off with a tribute to the past year’s challenges
and triumphs, the fireworks will then herald the promise of new beginnings
and thereafter, culminate to a 12-minute grand finale celebrating Singaporeans’
unyielding spirit as we embrace the future. Complete with specially curated
music played through speakers around the Bay, the public can look forward
to a sensory feast for the eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Marina Bay will feature inspiring light projections, light installations
and exciting live performances. This year’s Countdown invites everyone
to come together to create and celebrate timeless moments.</p>
