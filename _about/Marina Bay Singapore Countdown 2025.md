<p>The <strong><em>Marina Bay Singapore Countdown</em></strong>, presented
by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), returns for its 20th edition
with a collection of festivities to usher in 2025. This year’s Marina Bay
Singapore Countdown is part of the ONE Countdown series of celebratory
events islandwide organised to commemorate Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday
(SG60).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Festivities have already begun with illumi —one of the world’s largest
light and multimedia show – which has made its international premiere in
Singapore. In addition, look forward to more exciting activities that will
set the Bay abuzz in the weeks leading up to New Year’s Eve. These include
performances by homegrown talents at the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay
and a new series of Brightening Lives light projections on The Fullerton
Hotel Singapore, featuring artworks by artists with disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we usher in the New Year, look out for the spectacular 30-minute fireworks
display, designed by the team behind STAR ISLAND, that will illuminate
and dazzle the night sky from the Bay.</p>
