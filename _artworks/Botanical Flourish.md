<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Another artwork by Abraham Koh, <em>Botanical Flourish</em> seeks to bring
to life the multifaceted aspects of Singapore. Singapore is known as a
garden city but beyond flowers, leaves also add much vibrancy to the landscape
with its varying sizes, shapes and patterns. This artwork celebrates leaves
in all its glory and reminds us that nature is fragile and the importance
of protecting it to ensure that they can continue to grow and thrive.</p>
