<h3><strong>Artwork inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>This artwork explores the interplay of inclusivity and empowerment. Singapore
is made up of people of different races, abilities, talents, passions and
backgrounds. Young or old, everyone is important and can contribute to
society. Every one of us can achieve our goals if we believe in ourselves
and are supported. Given the right opportunities, we are empowered to succeed
in life if we persevere. No one can thrive or survive alone. We all need
each other, so we must help one another and live in harmony.</p>
